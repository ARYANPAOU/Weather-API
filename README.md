# Weather-API
This is a sleek and minimal weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide real-time weather updates through seamless API integration. Upon loading, the app fetches current weather data including temperature, wind speed, and humidity from a weather API such as OpenWeatherMap. The interface is intentionally kept clean and distraction-free, focusing on clarity and user experience. Weather conditions are visually represented with dynamic icons that update according to live data—sun for clear skies, clouds for overcast, raindrops for precipitation, and more—bringing a visually intuitive layer to the data. Users can enter a city name to get the current conditions, and the display adjusts instantly, reflecting the live readings.
